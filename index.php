                  For the past three years I have been striving to get my bachelors of Computer Science at the Masters University. After I graduate I am currently planning on pursuing the <a target="_blank" href="https://jetprogramusa.org/">JET program</a>. JET stands for Japan Exchange and Teaching. The program is essentially a paid exchange program where college graduates go to teach in Japanese high schools for two to five years. Although moving to Japan out of college is a bold move, I find that because of my past experiences and current passions it is justified. Much of the reasons for choosing to pursue Computer Science and consider the JET program originated in high school. Currently I am semi-fluent in Chinese (fully fluent when I was in China). This passion of mine began freshmen year of high school. I chose to take Chinese instead of Spanish because I felt that it would provide more of a challenge and it was a unique language compared to what everyone takes. Two years later I took my first trip to China. During that trip, my passion for Asian languages and international travel grew greatly. Since then, I have traveled every summer. I have grown to appreciate the unique and enriching experiences of traveling. Travel has become the discovery and pursuit of culture. On top of my love for travel, I love creating. The first two years of high school I took video class, creating unique and fun videos. The next two years I dove into film photography, producing beautiful and compelling photos. I loved the amazing amount of creativity film allowed. Things took a turn my senior year of high school. I decided to move away from arts and dive into the technical and scientific world. I took a computer science class. By the first month of the class, I had already finished the course work for the entire year and decided to take the AP class. I finished the course work for the AP by the end of the winter. My desire to create was met with the infinite possibilities Computer Science allowed. Because of those desires, I find myself here. Absolutely loving the amazing and intricate word of Computer Science. With the skills that I have, I look to continue to learn everything I can. Enjoying each season of life, in all of its quirks.

                        <p>
                          Ever since high school I have had a bad habit of adding too much fluff into how I write. I struggle sometimes to get to the point. I tend to be too “thorough” with my explanations and lack the balance of brevity in my sentence order and structure. It maybe the case that even this explanation contains fluff and lacks the necessary brevity to keep a reader engaged. Nevertheless, I must be aware of these issues and attempt to repair and improve how I write. I must remember that a reader is trying to understand not to look at the size of my work and say good job. I think part of the reason I have struggled with fluff in essays past is due to the need to meet the minimum number of pages or words. I find myself focusing less on this than what point I am trying to make.

                        <p>
                          One of the biggest challenges for me when attempting to write anything is assuring my undivided and uninterrupted focus on it. In other words, I get distracted quite easily. I find that my thoughts drift off the topic mid-sentence and must go back through the whole paragraph so that I can pick up where I left off. I cannot simply read the last sentence, and pick up where I left off. I need to remind myself of the context and make sure that I am staying true to the greater point I am making in that paragraph and essay. The thought of making every sentence tie in and add to the greater thesis of the essay a difficult exercise in writing. I tend to get stuck what I should or need to say next to accomplish my goal of completion. I find it especially difficult to write in high pressure situations because my mind easily drifts towards thinking about a specific issue that is dominating my mind. Overall, I have two solutions to alleviate my writers block. The first is getting up and doing something else for a bit and then revisiting the essay later to finish. The second is to find a way to be passionate about the topic of the essay. If I am passionate about something, it is difficult for me to shut up about the topic.

                        <p>
                          Wording is a challenge in that I am always trying to find the best way to verbalize a certain feeling or idea, but I cannot remember the word or how to describe it. Descriptions are awesome tools in writing, but if not practiced and done well it tends to show off the poor quality of a writer much quicker than a very articulate and capable writer. I of course tend to be in the first camp. I like to use unique and impressive words that I would like others to think I know.

                          The pictures to the left were taken when I was 18 years old. I was on a small fishing village called 枸杞岛(Gǒuqǐ dǎo) about 100 miles off the coast of Shanghai. The island is a popular summer vacation getaway for many Shanghainese. It is known for its unique landscape, relatively clean beaches, loads of sea food and an abandoned village on the north-east side of the island. I say relatively clean because most Chinese beaches are typically filled with landfill waste and other “materials”. I came to this island with my boss (at the time) and his friends for a small relatively unplanned vacation. I worked at a three-story hot-pot restaurant and bar in the Jing’an area as a host. I was a host because Chinese will flock to any foreigner. As a matter of fact, it is a popular practice in China to hire foreigners to boost your business name and sales. So, I suppose I was just a pretty face to boost their sales and the reason I joined was because they wanted to show off their prize.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          It took a long time to journey from Shanghai to this small four by two-mile island. We started our journey at 5 am and began to make our way to one of the world’s longest bridges called 东海大桥 (Dōnghǎi dàqiáo). The bridge translates to eastern sea big bridge, which I find slightly comical. Most of Chinese tends to have this similar style of word dictation. Driving down the bridge felt almost endless and truly lived up to its name of “big” bridge. It took close to an hour to cross the whole thing. Following the bridge, we boarded our one of two ferries. We had to go to a larger island and get on a different ship because there were no ferry routes that would run directly to Guoqi. We arrived at guoqi around 7pm and immediately made our way to a local restaurant for dinner. The restaurant owner was a friend of my boss and provided our breakfast, lunch and dinner for the rest of our time there. One of the photos on the left is a picture of what we ate each meal. There was little derivation from what we ate day to day and mostly consisted of very fresh seafood. I had to learn quick how to break apart whole crab, sea slugs, sea urchins, and a host of other sea food.

                          After our dinner, we made our way back to the hotel. I roomed with an older Chinese man who was an old friend of my boss. They called him 大武 (Dàwǔ) which means big fierce. I really did not know dawu before the trip, which made rooming with him an interesting experience. He snored horribly loud which made it almost impossible for me to fall asleep. I tried to avoid this by falling asleep before him, but he would always use his phone before falling asleep. His phone would make a loud droplet sound every time he touched the screen. Thus, my attempt at sleep that trip was denied. Apart from the sleepless nights, the experience was very interesting and enjoyable. The most memorable part of the trip was when we took a trip to the north-eastern side of the island where there was an abandoned village. The village was supposedly abandoned during the Japanese invasion and stands as a shrine to those that lost their lives during the war. It was difficult to make out much of what I was told about the island and abandoned village because of the thick Chinese accent the islanders had. Nevertheless, my time spent on Guoqi will remain with me for years to come.

                        <p>
                          This is a very difficult issue to approach. I want to define depression because I want to show that there is hope. I want to remind those that may be depressed that there is a way out and it is not something that someone is stuck with for the rest of their life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Depression is a long-term habit of having one thought dominate one’s mind, the feeling of meaninglessness. I know what this is like. It is suffocating and debilitating. Any momentary good feeling can be immediately drowned in an ocean of meaninglessness. Depression has many similarities to the habit of smoking cigarettes. Almost all of those that are addicted to smoking know that smoking is bad for their health, likewise those that are depressed know that the feeling of meaninglessness is very bad. Yet both parties still indulge their habits! They feel that they are bound to their habit not by choice. For I found that every time that I battled with depression I lost. I would succumb to the feeling of meaninglessness and do nothing and feel nothing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          So, how can one win against the battle of depression? The answer lies in good relationships. For it is not good for man to be alone! Therefore, one must seek help from those who love them. They must be reminded of their purpose and see that purpose lived out in other’s lives. The Gospel reminds us of our purpose, to love God and give glory to Him forever. That purpose lived out in a person’s life is energizing. It is a ray of hope in a dark world. One can never try to forget depression but remember and be reminded of the hope that is greater than it.

                        <p>The process of a producing a sheet of film from start to finish. When creating a film photograph you will need to have a few key materials: a film camera, film, photopaper, thick black bag with arm holes, can opener, film tank and reel, scissors, a timer, a thermometer, developer, fixer, and a sink with water temperature controls. You will start by taking the film camera and opening the back of the camera. Usually there is a small button or tab to open the back. Once opened take the film and place into the slot on the left. Make sure the film is upward, the inner tube of the film reel should be protruding on up. Take the excess film sheet and drag it from left to the right tube. There should be a slit on the right tube. Insert the film into the slit and advance the film wheel forward until the film is wrapped around the right tube securely. Close the back of the camera. Now its time to get creative! Go take some awesome photos. Make sure that the photos are properly exposed, thus a light meter may come in handy (there are apps that can do this). After you’ve got all your amazing pictures, you will need to process the film to see what you took. Pull the wheel on the left side of the camera and crank the film until it moves with little friction. Open the back of the camera and place the film alongside the can opener, film tank, film reel, and scissors into the thick dark bag. Make sure the film does not see any light or your photos will be lost forever! Place your arms into the bag and use the can opener to open the film and then cut the film from the inner tube. Feed the film into the slot on the film reel and ratchet the film into the reel. Place the reel into the film tank and cover the reel with the included funnel. Now it’s time to develop! Start by filling the tank with enough developer that it seems to cover the reel (you should NOT be able to see the film at this stage). Shake the tank continuously for the first 30 seconds, and then shake for 10-15 seconds every 30 seconds thereafter. Pour out the developer and then fill the tank with water for one minute. Repeat the developer process with the fixer. Wash the film and remove from the tank and reel. It is now time to see if your hard work has paid off. Take a nice look at the film before the final step of the process. Place the film into a warm dry area for at least 12hours or until dry. You now have developed a single roll of film. This process usually takes around a day.

                                My name is Matthew Clark. I have been studying Chinese for close to 7 years and I am very interested in Chinese music culture. I have found guzheng to be a particularly beautiful instrument from the way it plays to the way it looks. There are many manufactures that like to cut corners and use sub-par materials and construction to build their guzhengs. Your products and website look to be leagues better than much of the guzhengs available in the market today.
                            I am interested in your dark rosewood guzheng. I find the detail work on the body and the inlay to be exquisite. I love the minimalistic color scheme met with the intricate design. Who designed this zheng? What was his inspiration? For these details are deciding factors for my purchasing of your gorgeous guzheng. Apart from the painted artwork, what materials were used to create this piece? Where might they be sourced from? I am aware that the body is made of rosewood, but what were the strings, the inlay, or the risers made of? I would be very interested to find out if you could provide a silk string set. The ability to enjoy an authentic guzheng experience is very much dependent on whether the instrument has silk strings. Thus, the last and most important detail would be the sound quality. I would like to hear what the instrument sounds like. If you could link a clip of the instrument, I would feel very confident in buying your guzheng.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I look forward to your reply.

                        <p>The 17-fall semester will stand to be one of the more interesting and memorable semesters of my college experience. It is memorable for many reasons, yet the one that stands on top is the fact that I started to date an awesome girl. The second reason this semester will be very memorable is the fact that I had done a lot of serious soul searching about who I am and why I do the things I do. I will not explore the depths of who I learned I was and why I did the things that I did, but I want to take a moment and be thankful for the blessing my girlfriend has been to me. She has been a dear friend and an amazing example of a very dedicated and disciplined individual. Discipline and dedication have always been a struggle of mine, but I know now the importance of self-awareness. In other words, I need to be aware of my actions as I commit them and remind myself of the Gospel. For there is no greater hope than the hope and refuge we have in Christ! If I forget my purpose in Christ, I allow back my old habits and sin issues. I must never allow those things in. When I was able to focus and be disciplined with my time, I realized the great value in scholarship. I enjoyed exploring the intricate and exciting alleyways of academia. The experience was similar to seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time. You start out with a drive out to this thing, only seeing flat lands for miles and miles on end. You walk a long way on a flat path and eventually make your way to a lookout point. When I saw that massive expanse of beautiful earth, I realized there was so much more depth than what I had been seeing for the past could hours. Similarly, I now am beginning to see the depth in academia. One of the things that influenced this realization was the book “They Say I Say” by Cathy Birkenstein and Gerald Graff. Their ideas inspired me to write in a way that would challenge the ideas and thoughts of others with my own thoughts that had been built up on the foundation of well rounded research and thought. I loved the application process. I found that the inspiration I found from this book drove me to write and read more critically. I was like a child with a hammer finding every nail I could smack with my brute and primordial academic practices. I am still very young in the practice of writing. I had a lot to learn and by no means have it mastered. I look forward to exploring writing to greater depths and greater heights.

                        <h1>Ethnography</h1>
                        <p>
                          An hour in a Chinese tea store. Throughout my travels in China, one of the most consistent things I have found in each city I go to is Chinese tea shops. In more modern cities, tea stores tend to be more rare compared to the myriad of stores that would line the streets in small villages and Chinese sub-urban areas. It is strange to find anything consistent in a country that is filled with mismatched things and strange leftovers from other countries. Then again, I am relived to still be able to find a relic of Chinese past that has not been destroyed by the vicious action of their great leader Mao.
                        	When I walk into a tea store, the first thing I do is to observe the practices of the shop owner and the quality of their products. A good shop will typically have an owner be sitting in the back of the store drinking tea with friends or family. They will not take notice of most customers unless they are directly bothered. They do this to weed out those that are looking for a souvenir from those that wish to fuel their hobby and passion for tea. A shop owner that I had befriended in a small Venice like town told me that a person that is truly passionate about tea is a rare find. Upon discovery of such an individual, the owner would immediately change his cool and careless disposition to that of a small child getting a new toy. To sum up their expression, it would a silent excitement that is expressed in the immediate invite to enjoy lavish gifts of tea. This event is usually followed by an excessive amount of time spent sitting, drinking tea, and discussing the most recent political, social or economic issues. It is amazing to find a small tea shop owner casually discuss large and intellectually engaging issues on a day to day basis.

                        <h1 style="text-align:right;">Lazy Sunday Afternoon Lunches</h1>
                        <p>As a replacement to our family’s typical practice of inviting a large group of high schoolers and their parents over every Saturday night, we decided to begin to have lunches after church on Sunday. This decision was caused by a move to Mclean, Virginia from Los Angeles, California. We went from having a busy Saturday night filled with the sweet and salty smell of my “it’s too bad to eat” light kettle corn, to a deadly quiet and empty house. Our house was almost double the size of our last house, which made quiet days feel like I was in a cold museum. These feelings began to shift when we were greeted by the idea of enjoying a nice lunch with a few friends after church. The first time we did this, it was a mid-autumn afternoon. A light cold breeze shifted through our backyard, swaying the large trees filled with colorful leaves ready to break away to create massive piles of leaves that I would most likely have to rake up later. Our backyard contained a section a small creek that ran through a good part of Mclean. As we lounged in the cold metal chairs that my mom bought back when I was a kid, the soft sound of the creek played in the background. We decided to have rather different style of lunch and try to make a charcuterie, which is an assortment of Italian antipasti. Antipasti is essentially an assortment of all the ingredients that make up typical Italian except the actual pastas. So, we brought out plates stacked with fragrant cheeses and cured meats, a colorful arrangement of fruits, and olives and other picked vegetables. Of course, in typical Italian fashion my dad would bring out a bottle of red wine. Suffice it to say that my family and our friends really enjoyed this experience, to the point where our family made it a regular practice that still lives on to today.

                          I had a lot of time on my hands during high school. Dare I say that I had too much time on my hands. I dedicated a whole month to purpose of starting and finishing the Eragon series. I have never been a big reader. I typically do not read for pleasure or leisure, instead I watch anime or TV shows. I suppose the replacement of books with TV was and remains to be a poor decision on my part. I wanted to change that back when I began that series. I wanted to try reading and see how it went. I decided to read Eragon because the fantasy and story premise intrigued me. I watched the movie a few years back and felt very “meh” about it. I decided to see how much better the books were. I realized how encapsulating a book can be. I felt drawn into a different world. Reading these stories activated every part of my imagination and kept me thinking late at night about what would happen next or imagining the world that I read about. One thing that stuck out to me was how detail can inspire my mind to imagine. I felt like a child reading these books, it was as if I had never ridden a bike before and this was my glorious revelation. I went through those books so fast. I was a crack addict with these books. I could not get enough of them and once I was finished I felt that there was something missing. I wanted to continue to imagine, but the source stopped flowing. I should have continued on with another book, but because of my decision to replace a book with TV I lost interest in reading anything else. I look forward to when reading is no longer a chore, but a hobby and pleasure to do.

                        <h1 style="text-align:right;">The Chinese and Japanese Language</h1>
                        <p>I suppose when it comes to comparing language it tends to boil down to subjectivity. For it is all based on what perspective a certain individual has about the language, region, country, or culture. Some people generalize too much, and others tend be ignorant of the differences. I would not hold it against any American if they were not aware of the differences and similarities of the Chinese and Japanese language. I cannot assume they are experts, yet I can encourage that understanding other people’s language and culture is a vital practice that aids in the shaping our perspective and actions.
                        	Looking at the differences between these two languages is rather easy compared to the issues these the Chinese and Japanese have with each other. Let us tackle the structure of each language. Chinese is a tonal language, contains no alphabet and uses characters to form words. Japanese is not a tonal language, uses a large character based alphabet, and uses Chinese characters to shorten writing. In Chinese there are two main character sets, traditional and simplified. Traditional is used by Taiwan and in Japanese in form of Kanji. Mainland China uses simplified and yet the only difference between the two character sets is a couple extra strokes on a traditional character. Japanese has three character sets, two are dedicated to the alphabet and pronunciation and the third is the Kanji. Now many Chinese claim they hate the Japanese. The two main reasons for this hatred is their actions in World War II and their language stealing from China. The second reason is spammed across the one government controlled media source in China. Now without understanding a little bit about the language, it would be difficult to interact and understand with the dominating and unreasonable hatred the Chinese have for the Japanese.

                        <p>
                          Most of the reasons for my decision to pursue computer science began to develop my junior year of high school. By that that time I have just moved from California to Virginia with my family. I had taken my first trip to China and began to get to know our new neighbors who happened to be from Shanghai. To be more specific, the neighbor’s wife was from Shanghai and the husband was white. The husband worked for a branch in the government (I cannot say what) and has had much experience in China. At the time I was interested in pursuing international business because I felt that my Chinese language skills would go well business. The husband agreed but explained that international business would be helpful but not the best degree to get. He encouraged me to get a degree that I could get a job without depending on my Chinese language skill. He recommended I consider the technical field. At the same time, I began to culture an interest in VR (virtual reality). I fancied the idea of being in a game or place and felt strongly about exploring the topic myself. I decided that during my senior year I would take a computer science course. I chose to do this for a couple reasons. The first was to avoid any extra math classes because of the rather poor experience I had my junior year with pre-calculus. The second reason was to explore the idea of learning how to program for VR. The last reason was to consider and explore a technical degree. I started the course. I finished a year’s worth of assignments and concepts by the end of the first month. By the end of the semester, I had moved on and finished the course work for the AP. Thus began my journey into the great depths of computer science.  </p>
